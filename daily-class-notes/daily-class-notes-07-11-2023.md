# Daily Class Notes

### July 11, 2023

##### Action Items

- Familiarize yourself with the [CSS Diner](https://css-diner.netlify.app/) game. You do _not_ have to play it, but we _will_ be playing it to solidify our selector skills.
- Deploy an assignment solution of yours to GitHub Pages using [this guide](https://github.com/AnnieCannons/intro-to-programming-curriculum/blob/main/git/resources/github-pages-deployment-guide.md). The solution could be for either of the following:
  - Debugging HTML
  - HTML In Class Exercises

##### Slides Covered

- [Into to CSS](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFnIubtXC8/iFIr3Uf4Hlv4Tp80z_JLGA/edit), slides 1-11.

##### Assignments

- [Debugging HTML](https://github.com/AnnieCannons/debugging-html). We finished it up and turned it in today at lunch. Please see the readme for the project or where you turn it in on Canvas for directions on how to turn it in via Pull Request.
