# Daily Class Notes

### July 21, 2023

##### Action Items

- Fork and clone [the playground repository for the Udemy course](https://github.com/AnnieCannons/udemy-grid-course-playground). It's _not_ for turning in, but to use **when coding along with the course**, which you should do only _after_ watching each video.
- We'll be meeting with every student for at least 10 minutes in the next week to make sure we're on the same page on what if anything you still owe on Canvas.

##### Slides Covered

- [Intro to CSS](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFnIubtXC8/iFIr3Uf4Hlv4Tp80z_JLGA/edit), slides 60-65, 68-69.
