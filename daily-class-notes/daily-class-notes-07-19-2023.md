# Daily Class Notes

### July 19, 2023

##### Action Items

- Sign up for [Designing Inclusive & Accessible Technology in a Digital World](https://events.techinmotion.com/designing-inclusive-tech) event, which we will attend from 2pm ET/11am PT to 3pm ET/12pm PT. We will move lunch to 3pm ET/12pm PT.
- We'll be meeting with every student for at least 10 minutes in the next week to make sure we're on the same page on what if anything you still owe on Canvas.

##### Slides Covered

- [Intro to CSS](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFnIubtXC8/iFIr3Uf4Hlv4Tp80z_JLGA/edit), slides 45 and 47-56.

##### Assignments

- [CSS Diner](https://github.com/AnnieCannons/hot-mess), which is not an assignment to be turned in on Canvas but _is_ an assignment that will help you reinforce your selector knowledge.
