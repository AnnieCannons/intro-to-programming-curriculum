##### Action Items

###### Install VS Code

- Go to [VS Code's site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Click on blue button on the left to download the file.
- Open the downloaded file.
  - In Chrome, you can find a button that says something like "VS Code Darwin"—this is a shortcut to opening your just-downloaded file.
  - If you don't see that, you can launch the Finder app (your graphical file manager), go into Downloads, find the VS Code Darwin file, and double-click it.
- You should now have a file called Visual Studio Code in your Downloads folder. Drag it to the Applications folder to fully install it.

###### Install Oh-My-Zsh

- Navigate to [the installation section of Oh-My-Zsh's homepage](https://ohmyz.sh/#install).
- Select the whole line of code that starts with `sh -c`.
- Copy that text, either by going to the Edit menu at the top of your screen and choosing "Copy" or by pressing Cmd-c.
- Switch back to your terminal, paste the line of code in, and hit return.
- If it asks you if you want to install the command line tools, press OK or agree to all windows that pop up, and it will start downloading the command line tools you need.
- Once it's finished, run the line of code from Oh-My-Zsh's site again, and it should install.
