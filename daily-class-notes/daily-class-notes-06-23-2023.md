##### Action Items

- Install Git & get a GitHub account. Here is [our full Git and GitHub setup guide](https://github.com/AnnieCannons/intro-to-programming-06-2023/blob/main/git/git-setup-guide.md), and we got through the Send Us Your GitHub Username section under GitHub Authentication.
- Don't forget to send us your GitHub username in the slack thread for it in #itp-23-class-chat please!
- Optional but highly recommended: follow the steps in [these directions from Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) under the "Launching from the command line" section to get the `code` command in your terminal.
