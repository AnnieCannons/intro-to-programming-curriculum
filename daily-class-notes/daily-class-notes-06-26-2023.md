##### Action Items

- Authenticated to GitHub using [our Git setup guide](https://github.com/AnnieCannons/intro-to-programming-06-2023/blob/main/git/git-setup-guide.md).
- Added the VS Code `code` command to our terminals using [these directions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line). **Make sure you've also done step 4** in [the installation section](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac), moving VS Code to your Applications folder! If it's not in there, the `code` command may not work.
