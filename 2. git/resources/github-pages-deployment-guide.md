# How To Deploy A Repo To GitHub Pages

Deploying a repository to GitHub Pages allows you to take any repo with an `index.html` file and have it become a website or app on the internet for anyone to see.

See [GitHub Pages' page](https://pages.github.com/) for additional info, or simply follow our directions for deploying a repository of yours!

### Instructions

**Please keep in mind that these instructions can change, as they're specific to the current GitHub interface as of 2023-07-11.**

- Navigate in your web browser to the repository you want to deploy. Make sure it's one of _your_ repositories—it should have your username in the address.
- Click "Settings". It should be to the right of "Code" in the menu near the top of the page. If you have a "3 dot" menu at the right side, click on it to pull a menu down with "Settings" as an option, then click that.
- Click on "Pages", which should be about halfway down the menu on the left side of the page.
- Under the heading "Branch"is a menu that should currently say "None". Click on "None" and select "main" from the list.
- Press the "Save" button.
- Reload the page every once in a while to see if it's done deploying. It should only take a couple of minutes. **You'll know it's done when:** there's a banner under the heading "GitHub Pages" that says "your site is live".
- Click on the "Visit site" button on that banner to see your deployed site! Feel free to share that page with anyone else—it's available for everyone to visit now!
