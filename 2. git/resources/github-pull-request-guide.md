# How To Open A Pull Request To Turn In Your Assignments

- Open your **browser** and navigate to **GitHub**.
- Log in to GitHub if you're not already.
- Navigate in your browser to the repo of **your fork** of the assignment on GitHub.
  - Double-check that it's not the **AnnieCannons** repository. You can tell it's your fork when the web address you're at has **your username** in it.
- **Click on the "Contribute" menu**. It should be to the right of text that says "This branch is [some number] commits ahead of AnnieCannons:main."
- **In the dropdown menu**, click the "Open pull request" button.
- On the next page, **click "Create pull request"**.
- **Turn in** the assignment using **the URL from the page you are now at**. It should be `https://www.github.com/AnnieCannons/[name of assignment]/pull/[a number]`. If it does _not_ have that basic form, **check the previous steps**. Most likely, you skipped the step just before this!
